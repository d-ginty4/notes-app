This application is a remake of my final year college project, a note taking and organization desktop app that used electron. The original project was very simple with no frameworks used and very few libraries used, this resulted in a very messy application with lots of repetition and unnecessarily long and confusing files. The application was connected to a [spring backend](https://github.com/d-ginty4/Final-Year-Project) which it interacted with through the use of XMLHttpRequests. My aim is to remake the application with the hope of making it more scalable and readable and to then build on the application's functionality.
